This my final project for the Introduction to Databases with SQL from Harvard University with the title "Healthcare Insurance Management System.
It is a one person project. In the course we used sqlite so for this project I used sqlite as well.
Some functions are not covered in the course, however, to answer some complex questions in the project I had to research and used them were necessary to optimize my work.
